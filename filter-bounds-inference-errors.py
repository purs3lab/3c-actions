# Exits 1 if the input contains errors that should not be ignored. For this to
# be useful, the original pipeline should be run with `pipefail` off.

# This could likely be implemented as a shell script using `sed`, etc., but it
# looked like it might become messy. Once I took the plunge to Python, I didn't
# regret it: I find the Python much clearer. ~ Matt
